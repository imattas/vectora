 * back as `%3B`, and a payload that no longer separates renders as one row
 * containing a `;` — which then fails to parse. Equations never contain a bare
 * `;` (it is only the row separator, as the public syntax reference states), so normalizing the
 * encoded form is unambiguous.
 *
 * Rows are then decoded exactly once. Decoding the whole payload up front
 * instead would also un-escape any other `%`-sequence before the split, so a
